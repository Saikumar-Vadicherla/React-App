It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"card\">\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <div class=\"image-section\">\n                    <img src=\"https://edyoda.s3.amazonaws.com/media/blog-images/3.png\" alt=\"Card 4 Image\">\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"text-section\">\n                    <h2 class=\"title\">Challenges of Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics</h2>\n                    <div class=\"author-container\">\n                        <span class=\"author\">EdYoda  </span>\n                        <span class=\"date\">| 24 Aug 2019</span>\n                    </div>\n                    <p class=\"description\">Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an important part of computer science.

It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card\">\n                <div class=\"item\">\n                    <div class=\"image-section\">\n                        <img src=\"https://edyoda.s3.amazonaws.com/media/blog-images/3.png\" alt=\"Card 4 Image\">\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"text-section\">\n                        <h2 class=\"title\">Challenges of Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics</h2>\n                        <div class=\"author-container\">\n                            <span class=\"author\">EdYoda  </span>\n                            <span class=\"date\">| 24 Aug 2019</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <p class=\"description\">Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling the process of optimization, discovering insights and improved decision making. This potential relies on the ability to extract value from big data and provide data analytics. Machine learning is the ability to learn from data, provide insights, predictions, suggestions from data which help in the decision-making process.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"card\">\n                <div class=\"item\">\n                    <div class=\"image-section\">\n                        <img src=\"https://edyoda.s3.amazonaws.com/media/blog-images/5.png\" alt=\"Card 5 Image\">\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"text-section\">\n                        <h2 class=\"title\">Breaking the Myths around Cybersecurity</h2>\n                        <div class=\"author-container\">\n                            <span class=\"author\">EdYoda  </span>\n                            <span class=\"date\">| 24 Aug 2019</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <p class=\"description\">As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily, cybersecurity is becoming an important concern for all companies today.
