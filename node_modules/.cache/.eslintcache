Well, one of its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of computing were all about solving problems using set instructions and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data, training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus, in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little deeper.</p>\n                  </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"card\">\n              <div className=\"item\">\n                  <div className=\"image-section\">\n                      <img src=\"https://edyoda.s3.amazonaws.com/media/blog-images/6.png\" alt=\"Card 2 Image\"/>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"text-section\">\n                      <h2 className=\"title\">LAMP Stack Vs MEAN stack: Choosing the right platform for your web application development</h2>\n                      <div className=\"author-container\">\n                          <span className=\"author\">EdYoda  </span>\n                          <span className=\"date\">| 24 Aug 2019</span>\n                      </div>\n                      <p className=\"description\">In today’s dynamic world, rapid web application development with a smooth user interface that can adapt to specific features is the main business requirement. Many organizations around the world that intensely depend on programming for their everyday business operations, the big business level applications, sites and servers have become apparent. It is important to use consistent, scalable and standardized software when developing a new application.\n\n                          A web stack is a collection of software that is used to build a web application. Many E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Walmart and eBay provide the best user experience which is one of the reasons why they maintain their position at the top. Currently, the most popular web stacks are: LAMP stack and MEAN stack.\n                          \n                          Let us try to understand more about these web application development platforms.</p>\n                  </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"card\">\n              <div className=\"item\">\n                  <div className=\"image-section\">\n                      <img src=\"https://edyoda.s3.amazonaws.com/media/blog-images/4.png\" alt=\"Card 3 Image\"/>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"text-section\">\n                      <h2 className=\"title\">Impact of Cloud Computing in various industries</h2>\n                      <div className=\"author-container\">\n                          <span className=\"author\">EdYoda  </span>\n                          <span className=\"date\">| 24 Aug 2019</span>\n                      </div>\n                      <p className=\"description\">Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud.</p>\n                  </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"card\">\n              <div className=\"item\">\n                  <div className=\"image-section\">\n                      <img src=\"https://edyoda.s3.amazonaws.com/media/blog-images/3.png\" alt=\"Card 4 Image\"/>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"text-section\">\n                      <h2 className=\"title\">Challenges of Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics</h2>\n                      <div className=\"author-container\">\n                          <span className=\"author\">EdYoda  </span>\n                          <span className=\"date\">| 24 Aug 2019</span>\n                      </div>\n                      <p className=\"description\">Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling the process of optimization, discovering insights and improved decision making.
